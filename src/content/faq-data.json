                "answer": "<p>Local Control is FirstNet’s web portal for Public Safety Entities (PSEs).  In Local Control, PSE communications administrators manage their PSE’s access to and use of the FirstNet Network by managing users, devices, solutions, apps, services and billing for their organization.   </p><p>Local Control has an interactive map that provides public safety communications professionals with visibility into current network coverage quality, along with overlays of weather, traffic, and network alerts. Public safety communications professionals can request both emergency and planning assistance when planning for or responding to an event that may have heavy network demands or affects the network itself.</p>",

The MDM solutions supported by FirstNet are AirWatch, MobileIron, and IBM MaaS360. If you do not use one of these MDM’s, you can recommend an app in Local Control, which will flag it in the App Store for all members of your PSE. However, it is up to the user to determine whether to download the app to his/her device from the App Store.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>FirstNet branded apps are those that carry the FirstNet brand/name – these apps go through the most rigorous performance and security tests. FirstNet endorsed apps are created by non-FirstNet entities, but have passed such high levels of performance and security tests that they receive the FirstNet seal of approval. General apps are created by members of the general public, and must go through security and basic performance tests prior to their release on the FirstNet App Store. Government apps undergo similar testing to general apps, but were created by government entities.</p>",

                "answer": "<p>No, not through Local Control. The push feature is a one-way communication. To remove an app that has already been pushed to your third-party MDM, the administrator must do so in the MDM itself.</p>",

                "question": "When would I need to 're-push' an app?  Are new versions automatically pushed?",
                "answer": "<p>Since the push to MDM is a one-way communication, Local Control does not know if an app currently exists in a configured MDM. If a user pushed an app to his/her MDM and then removed it from the MDM directly, the user may want an option to re-submit the app to the MDM at a later date.  Additionally, this can be used to push new versions.</p>",

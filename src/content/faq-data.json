        "question": "What is FirstNet Local Control?",
        "answer": "Local Control is FirstNet’s web portal for Public Safety Entities (PSEs).  In Local Control, PSE communications administrators manage their PSE’s access to and use of the FirstNet Network by managing users, devices, solutions, apps, services and billing for their organization.\nLocal Control has an interactive map that provides public safety communications professionals with visibility into current network coverage quality, along with overlays of weather, traffic, and network alerts. Public safety communications professionals can request both emergency and planning assistance when planning for or responding to an event that may have heavy network demands or affects the network itself.",

If you do not use one of these MDM’s, you can recommend an app in Local Control, which will flag it in the App Store for all members of your PSE. However, it is up to the user to determine whether to download the app to his/her device from the App Store.",

        "answer": "FirstNet Local Control displays all apps that have been submitted through FirstNet App Control and that have passed the FirstNet Certification & Accreditation process. The “Available” checkbox on each app card gives the PSE Administrator the ability to block apps from displaying to their members in the FirstNet App Store.",

        "question": "What is an MDM?",
        "answer": "Mobile device management (MDM) solutions are used for the administration of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, laptops, and desktop computers. Some PSEs may opt to manage distribution of apps through a third-party MDM solution. If users have an MDM account, Local Control allows users to push apps to that MDM.  The MDM solutions supported by FirstNet are AirWatch, MobileIron, and IBM MaaS360.",

        "category": "Configure MDM"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I remove apps from my MDM?",
        "answer": "No, not through Local Control. The push feature is a one-way communication. To remove an app that has already been pushed to your third-party MDM, the administrator must do so in the MDM itself.",

        "category": "Configure MDM"
      },
      {
        "question": "When would I need to 're-push' an app?  Are new versions automatically pushed?",
        "answer": "Since the push to MDM is a one-way communication, Local Control does not know if an app currently exists in a configured MDM. If a user pushed an app to his/her MDM and then removed it from the MDM directly, the user may want an option to re-submit the app to the MDM at a later date.  Additionally, this can be used to push new versions.",

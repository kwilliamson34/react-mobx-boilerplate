They need accurate information about the hazardous substances, the emergency resources available, and the surrounding environmental conditions to save lives and minimize the impact on the environment and physical property.

The key information presented to the user about a substance varies depending on this role, so that the information most relevant to the respective job can be quickly accessed.* Radiological and biological substance support.* ERG 2012 data; the Android version of WISER includes the full ERG 2012 tool.* Mobile support, providing first responders critical information where they need it, when they need it.",
